## Roadmap

The project is still in its early stages, and there are many features that can be added to improve its functionality.

Some of the features that are planned for future releases include:
- **Visualisation**: Generate visual graphs to represent the stability of components.
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: Use DAGs to represent the dependencies between components.
    - This will allow us to ensure components decrease in stability in the direction of dependencies.
    - This will also help identify cycles and other issues in the architecture.
- **Metric Explanations**: Provide explanations for the metrics used in the analysis.
    - This will explain what the metrics mean and how they can be used to improve the architecture.
