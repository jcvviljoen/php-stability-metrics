### New plugins

The project is designed to be extensible, so you can create new plugins to add more functionality.

For example, if you have a specific configuration file that you'd like to use,
you can create a new `ConfigLoader` to support it!

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
composer tests
```
